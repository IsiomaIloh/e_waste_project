# **E-Waste Dataset for Recycling and Disposal Analysis**

Welcome to the **E-Waste Dataset for Recycling and Disposal Analysis**! This dataset provides detailed information about electronic waste (e-waste) collected for recycling and disposal, offering a valuable resource for research, policymaking, and environmental sustainability efforts.

## **Overview**
This dataset contains 3,000 rows of data, each representing a specific e-waste item collected. The data covers various attributes, including product details, collection information, recycling methods, and environmental impact metrics. It is designed to help researchers, policymakers, and environmentalists understand e-waste trends, optimize recycling processes, and reduce the environmental footprint of discarded electronic products.

## **Key Features**
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each e-waste item.
- **Item_Name**: The name of the electronic product (e.g., smartphone, refrigerator).
- **Brand**: Manufacturer of the product (e.g., Apple, Samsung, LG).
- **Model**: Specific model number or name of the product.
- **Category**: Classification of the product (e.g., mobile, appliance).
- **Year_of_Purchase**: Year the product was purchased.
- **Condition**: State of the product upon collection (e.g., working, broken).
- **Quantity**: Number of units of the product.
- **Weight_kg**: Weight of the product in kilograms.
- **Recycle_Method**: Recycling approach (e.g., manual, automated).
- **Location**: Site where the e-waste was collected.
- **Recycling_Facility**: Facility responsible for the recycling process.
- **Collection_Date**: Date the e-waste was collected.
- **End_Use**: Purpose of the recycled materials (e.g., raw materials, parts).
- **Recycled_Price_USD**: Value in USD of the recycled item.
- **Toxic_Components**: Toxic elements present in the product (e.g., lead, mercury).
- **E-Waste_Collector**: Organization or company responsible for collecting the e-waste.
- **Carbon_Footprint**: Environmental impact of the recycling process.
- **Exported_To**: Destination country for recycled materials.

## **Applications**
- **Data Analysis**: Explore trends in e-waste management and recycling.
- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Study carbon footprints and toxic components.
- **Policy Development**: Support the creation of regulations and sustainability strategies.
- **Optimization of Recycling**: Enhance recycling methods and reduce waste.
